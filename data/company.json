        "name": "Thorin Oakenshield",
        "description": "Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to Dwarven prince Thráin II in the city of The Lonely Mountain. Early in his youth, he and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug in TA 2770. While in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated when he participated in the Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath the East-gate of Moria. At some point in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken tree branch found on the floor as a shield, he gained the epithet 'Oakenshield,' which would remain with him even in death.[2]",

        "name": "Fíli and Kíli",
        "description": "Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother Dís. They were also nephews of Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his long nose, the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.[2] As the youngest Dwarves, Fíli and Kíli had the sharpest eyes, and were often sent scouting or searching. It was they that found the Front Porch while in the Misty Mountains.[3] With the other Dwarves, Fíli and Kíli encountered spiders and were later imprisoned by the Elvenking Thranduil.[4] They escaped the cells thanks to Bilbo, traveling down the river in barrels until they reached Lake-town.[5] The brothers accompanied Thorin and Bilbo to Lake-town while the others rested by the river.[6] At the feet of the Lonely Mountain, Fíli and Kíli scouted Ravenhill and found the Front Gate with Balin and Bilbo. Also, with Bilbo, they found the side-door leading into the mountain.[7] Both bothers were killed while defending the mortally wouned Thorin Oakenshield in the Battle of Five Armies, and all three were buried with honor.[8]",
